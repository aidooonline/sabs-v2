# üéØ WHAT'S NEXT - COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN
**SABS v2 Post-Emergency Fixes Roadmap**

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ **Emergency Infrastructure FIXED** - Ready for Development Phase  
**Updated:** December 2024

---

## üöÄ **CURRENT STATE SUMMARY**

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR WINS ACHIEVED**
- **Backend Testing**: 4 services now have working test infrastructure (28 tests total)
- **Frontend Testing**: 323 tests still passing, no degradation
- **Jest Configurations**: All services have proper test setup
- **ESLint**: **WORKING** (finding real code issues vs config errors)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES**
- **Code Quality**: 63 ESLint errors in Identity Service alone (unused vars, imports)
- **Disabled Tests**: 1,321 lines of disabled frontend tests
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright hanging issues unresolved
- **Real Implementation**: Current backend tests are placeholders

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** (This Week)

### **1. Fix Frontend Disabled Tests** üî¥ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Why Critical:** 1,321 lines of comprehensive tests are disabled

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Re-enable ApprovalDashboard tests (655 lines)
cd frontend
mv tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx.disabled tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx

# Step 2: Run tests to see what breaks
npm test

# Step 3: Fix any mock/import issues
# Step 4: Ensure ApiMocks and TestFramework work properly
```

**Expected Issues:**
- Mock API endpoints may need updates
- Test data generators might need fixes
- Component imports may have changed

### **2. Fix Frontend Performance Tests** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Re-enable Performance tests (666 lines)
mv tests/performance/PerformanceTests.test.tsx.disabled tests/performance/PerformanceTests.test.tsx

# Step 2: Fix any memory/timeout issues
# Step 3: Update performance benchmarks
```

### **3. Fix E2E Test Hanging** üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Issue:** Playwright tests hang/timeout

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Step 1: Debug Playwright configuration
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e -- --headed --timeout=30000

# Step 2: Check for async issues in home.spec.ts
# Step 3: Add proper wait conditions
# Step 4: Implement login/logout E2E flows
```

### **4. Backend Code Quality** üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Status:** ESLint finding 63 errors in Identity Service

**Action Steps:**
```bash
# Identity Service has 63 ESLint errors
# Company Service needs ESLint config
# Accounts Service needs ESLint config  
# Mobile Service needs ESLint config

# Fix unused imports and variables across all services
```

## üìã **PHASE 2 OBJECTIVES** (Next 2 Weeks)

### **1. Real Backend Service Implementation** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Current State:** Tests exist but services are placeholders

#### **Identity Service - Real Implementation**
- [ ] Implement actual AuthService with JWT generation
- [ ] Connect to real database entities
- [ ] Add password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Implement 2FA with Speakeasy
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security

#### **Company Service - Real Implementation**  
- [ ] Implement CompanyService with CRUD operations
- [ ] Add multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Implement service credit management
- [ ] Add staff role management

#### **Accounts Service - Real Implementation**
- [ ] Implement CustomerService with database
- [ ] Add account creation/management
- [ ] Implement transaction processing
- [ ] Add balance calculations

#### **Mobile Service - Real Implementation**
- [ ] Implement device registration
- [ ] Add mobile session management
- [ ] Implement push notifications
- [ ] Add mobile-specific authentication

### **2. Integration Testing** üü° **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current State:** Only unit tests exist

**Action Steps:**
- [ ] Create service-to-service integration tests
- [ ] Test authentication flow across services
- [ ] Add database integration tests
- [ ] Test multi-tenant data isolation

### **3. Frontend Code Quality Fixes** üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Issues:**
- 50+ console.log statements in production code
- Multiple React Hook dependency warnings
- Image optimization warnings
- Unescaped HTML entities

---

## üìä **PHASE 3 OBJECTIVES** (Weeks 3-4)

### **1. Advanced Testing Infrastructure**
- [ ] Load testing with K6
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Stress testing for concurrent users

### **2. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
- [ ] Enforce 90% test coverage minimum
- [ ] Add automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement deployment gates
- [ ] Add performance regression testing

### **3. Documentation & Monitoring**
- [ ] API documentation with Swagger
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

---

## üö® **CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Phase 2 Completion Criteria**
- [ ] **Frontend**: All disabled tests re-enabled and passing (1,321 lines)
- [ ] **Backend**: Real service implementations with 70%+ coverage
- [ ] **E2E**: Playwright tests working without hanging

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT**

### **Start Here (Today):**

1. **Re-enable ApprovalDashboard tests:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   mv tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx.disabled tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx
   npm test
   ```

2. **Fix any immediate issues from re-enabled tests**

3. **Create ESLint configs for remaining backend services**

4. **Begin implementing real AuthService logic in Identity Service**

### **This Week's Goals:**
- ‚úÖ All frontend tests re-enabled and passing
- ‚úÖ ESLint working across all backend services  
- ‚úÖ At least one real backend service implementation started

---

## ‚ö° **QUICK WINS AVAILABLE**

### **Easy Fixes (1-2 hours each):**
1. Copy ESLint config to other backend services
2. Remove console.log statements from frontend
3. Fix React Hook dependency warnings
4. Update unused import/variable names with underscore prefix

### **Medium Effort (4-8 hours each):**
1. Re-enable and fix disabled frontend tests
2. Implement real AuthService with database
3. Fix E2E test hanging issues
4. Add integration tests between services

### **Large Effort (1-2 days each):**
1. Complete real implementation of all backend services
2. Establish comprehensive load testing infrastructure
3. Build advanced monitoring and alerting system

---

## üéâ **SUCCESS DECLARATION CRITERIA**

**‚úÖ Ready for Production When:**
- All tests passing (frontend + backend + integration + E2E)
- 90%+ test coverage across all services
- Zero ESLint errors/warnings
- Load testing passes for expected user base
- Security testing completed
- CI/CD pipeline enforces quality gates

---

**üöÄ The foundation is solid. Time to build comprehensive functionality on top of this infrastructure!**

**Next Action:** Start by re-enabling the disabled frontend tests and fixing any immediate issues that arise.
