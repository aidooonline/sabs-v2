## 🚧 Technical Notes for Development Team

### TypeScript Configuration
Some linting errors were encountered related to JSX and React imports. These appear to be TypeScript configuration issues that need to be addressed at the project level:

```typescript
// Issues to resolve:
- React import declarations
- JSX.IntrinsicElements interface
- Object.fromEntries support (target lib configuration)
```

### Recommended Fixes
1. Update `tsconfig.json` to include newer ES lib versions
