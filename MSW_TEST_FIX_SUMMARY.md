# MSW Test Setup Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The job failed because three test suites did not run successfully due to MSW (Mock Service Worker) setup issues:

- `tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx`
- `tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.simple.test.tsx`
- `tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.minimal.test.tsx`

The error trace pointed to an issue in MSW's `parseWorkerRequest.ts` causing a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clone')" error.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:

1. **Conflicting MSW Setups**: Individual test files were setting up their own MSW servers using `setupServer` from `msw/node`
2. **Jest Setup Conflicts**: The `jest.setup.js` file had a complex custom fetch mock that interfered with MSW's request interception
3. **Multiple Server Instances**: Each test file was creating its own server instance, causing conflicts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated MSW Server Setup (`frontend/tests/setup/mocks/server.ts`)

- **Fixed**: Replaced the temporary mock MSW setup with real MSW v1 implementation
- **Added**: Proper `setupServer` import from `msw/node`
- **Added**: Comprehensive request handlers using MSW v1 `rest` API syntax
- **Added**: Handlers for all approval workflow endpoints (`/api/approval-workflow/workflows`, `/api/approval-workflow/dashboard/stats`, `/api/approval-workflow/dashboard/queue-metrics`)

### 2. Updated Jest Setup (`frontend/jest.setup.js`)

- **Removed**: Complex custom fetch mock that conflicted with MSW
- **Simplified**: Basic fetch implementation only used when MSW is not present
- **Removed**: Fetch mock cleanup logic that was interfering with MSW

### 3. Updated Individual Test Files

**ApprovalDashboard.simple.test.tsx** ✅ PASSING
- **Removed**: Individual `setupServer` import and setup
- **Changed**: Uses global MSW server with `server.use()` to add test-specific handlers
- **Removed**: `beforeAll`, `afterEach`, and `afterAll` MSW lifecycle management

**ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx** ❌ STILL FAILING
- **Removed**: Individual MSW server setup
- **Changed**: Uses global MSW server with `server.use()` to add test-specific handlers

**ApprovalDashboard.minimal.test.tsx** ❌ STILL FAILING
- **Removed**: Individual MSW server setup
- **Changed**: Uses global MSW server with `server.use()` to add test-specific handlers

### 4. TestFramework Integration (`frontend/tests/setup/testFramework.ts`)

- **Existing**: Already had proper MSW server lifecycle management:
  - `beforeAll(() => server.listen())`
  - `afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())`
  - `afterAll(() => server.close())`

## Current Status

### ✅ WORKING
- **ApprovalDashboard.simple.test.tsx**: 2/2 tests passing
- **MSW Server Setup**: Properly configured with real MSW v1 API
- **Jest Configuration**: No longer conflicts with MSW

### ❌ STILL FAILING  
- **ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx**: All tests failing with clone error
- **ApprovalDashboard.minimal.test.tsx**: 1/1 test failing with clone error

### Error Details
The remaining failing tests show the same error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clone')
at /workspace/node_modules/@reduxjs/toolkit/src/query/fetchBaseQuery.ts:293:36
```

This suggests that RTK Query's `fetchBaseQuery` is receiving a response object that doesn't have a `clone()` method.

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Verify MSW Version Compatibility
```bash
npm list msw
```
Current version: `msw@1.3.5`

### 2. Update MSW to Latest v1 Version
```bash
npm install msw@^1.3.5
```

### 3. Alternative Solution: Mock fetchBaseQuery
If MSW continues to have issues, we can mock the fetchBaseQuery directly:

```typescript
// In test files
jest.mock('@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'),
  fetchBaseQuery: () => jest.fn(),
}));
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Fix
Add Node.js specific polyfills for Response.clone():

```javascript
// In jest.setup.js
if (typeof global.Response !== 'undefined' && !global.Response.prototype.clone) {
  global.Response.prototype.clone = function() {
    return new Response(this.body, {
      status: this.status,
      statusText: this.statusText,
      headers: this.headers
    });
  };
}
```

## File Changes Made

1. **`frontend/tests/setup/mocks/server.ts`**: Complete rewrite with real MSW implementation
2. **`frontend/jest.setup.js`**: Removed conflicting fetch mock
3. **`frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.simple.test.tsx`**: Updated to use global MSW server
4. **`frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx`**: Updated to use global MSW server  
5. **`frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.minimal.test.tsx`**: Updated to use global MSW server

## Test Results Summary

- **Before**: 0/3 test suites passing (MSW import errors)
- **After**: 1/3 test suites passing (MSW working but clone errors remain)
- **Progress**: 33% improvement with proper MSW setup established

The foundation is now correct - we have a proper MSW setup that works with one test file. The remaining issues appear to be related to RTK Query's interaction with MSW-generated Response objects in the Node.js test environment.
