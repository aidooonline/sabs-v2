- **AND** time filters should be easily accessible and usable

### **AC7: Performance Requirements**
- **GIVEN** I am loading the dashboard
- **WHEN** I navigate to the dashboard page
- **THEN** the initial load should complete within 2 seconds
- **AND** filter changes should update data within 1 second

### **AC8: Error Handling**
- **GIVEN** the backend reporting API is unavailable
- **WHEN** I try to load the dashboard
- **THEN** I should see a user-friendly error message
- **AND** cached data should be displayed if available

---

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **Frontend Implementation**
- React/Next.js dashboard components with TypeScript
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS or similar
- Real-time updates using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
- Client-side caching for improved performance
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

### **Backend API Requirements**
- RESTful endpoints in the Reporting Service:
  - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/summary` - Role-based dashboard data
  - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/metrics` - Time-filtered metrics
  - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/real-time` - WebSocket/SSE endpoint
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- Multi-tenant data filtering by company_id
- Query optimization for fast dashboard response times

### **Database Considerations**
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Consider read replicas for dashboard queries
- Implement CQRS pattern for reporting data
- Aggregate tables for common dashboard metrics
