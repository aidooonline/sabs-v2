## Technical Implementation

### 1. Transaction Processing Service (`transaction-processing.service.ts`) - 1,023 lines

**Core Features:**
- **Atomic Processing:** Database transactions with pessimistic locking for data consistency
- **Concurrent Processing:** Batch processing with configurable concurrency limits (max 5 parallel)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with automatic rollback and retry capabilities
- **Performance Optimization:** Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed data

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
processTransaction(companyId, transactionId, processedBy, forceProcess)
processMultipleTransactions(companyId, transactionIds, processedBy)
reverseTransaction(companyId, originalTransactionId, reversedBy, reason)
calculateTransactionFees(transaction, account)
generateReceipt(transaction, account)
```

**Fee Structure Configuration:**
```typescript
withdrawal: {
  savings: { baseFee: 2.00, percentageRate: 0.005, maxFee: 50.00 },
