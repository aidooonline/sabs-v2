# Project Brief: Sabs (v2)

## Introduction / Problem Statement

[cite_start]The project is a complete re-engineering of an existing micro-finance system currently operating in Ghana. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The current system, which consists of a web app, a React Native Expo mobile app, and a Laravel API, has successfully served a small group of field agents but is now facing significant **performance, maintainability, and infrastructure challenges**. [cite: 1, 2] [cite_start]Key issues include system slowdowns due to unoptimized queries and infrastructure strain, [cite: 2] [cite_start]code complexity hindering further development, [cite: 2] [cite_start]dependency management issues on the mobile client, [cite: 2] [cite_start]and security vulnerabilities on the current hosting platform. [cite: 3]

This project aims to solve these problems by building a new, decoupled, and highly scalable platform from the ground up. [cite_start]The goal is to provide a robust foundation that supports massive user growth, improves agent efficiency, enhances security, and allows for the rapid development of future financial products like loans and insurance. [cite: 1, 5]

## Vision & Goals

* **Vision:** To create a scalable, secure, and resilient **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** for the FinTech industry. [cite_start]This platform will empower field agents and their companies across Africa with robust tools for micro-finance, while providing ongoing value through billable, integrated services like SMS and a sophisticated AI Assistant. [cite: 5, 6, 7]

* **Primary Goals (for the Sabs v2 MVP):**
    1.  [cite_start]**Re-platform for Scale & Stability:** Successfully build and migrate core functionality to a new, decoupled, cloud-native architecture, completely resolving the performance, security, and maintainability issues of the old system. [cite: 1, 2, 3]
    2.  [cite_start]**Enhance Agent Efficiency:** Implement the "Dynamic Commission Engine," ensure rock-solid, reliable Bluetooth printing, and deliver a fast, responsive UI. [cite: 3]
    3.  [cite_start]**Launch Core Customer & Loan Services:** Deliver the initial customer-facing USSD features and launch the first version of the urgently needed `LoanService`. [cite: 4, 8]
    4.  [cite_start]**Enable Multi-Company Operations:** Establish the secure multi-tenant architecture required to safely onboard and manage multiple, separate agent companies. [cite: 8, 9]
    5.  [cite_start]**Implement a Multi-Tenant Credit System:** Deliver a system to meter, manage, and bill companies for their usage of platform services, starting with SMS and AI token usage. [cite: 7]
    6.  [cite_start]**Deliver an Integrated AI Assistant:** Launch a role-aware AI Assistant that provides business intelligence and operational support for both agents and administrators, with secure, permission-based access to data. [cite: 6, 7]

* **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
    * [cite_start]**Performance:** Average API response time for critical transactions should be under 200ms. [cite: 10]
    * [cite_start]**Reliability:** Achieve 99.9%+ uptime and eliminate all instances of critical errors like double-transactions. [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]**Agent Adoption:** All existing agents are successfully transitioned to Sabs (v2) with positive feedback on speed and usability. [cite: 3]
    * [cite_start]**Customer Engagement:** Track the number of successful USSD transactions per week post-launch. [cite: 4]
    * [cite_start]**Business Growth:** Successfully onboard one new agent company. [cite: 9] [cite_start]Successfully issue and manage the first set of loans through the new system. [cite: 8]
    * [cite_start]**Commercial Adoption:** See the first new company successfully purchase and utilize SMS or AI credit bundles. [cite: 7]
    * [cite_start]**AI Value:** Track the number of queries made to the AI assistant, indicating its usage and value. [cite: 6]

## Target Audience / Users

### Field Agent
[cite_start]The primary, day-to-day users of the system. [cite: 1] [cite_start]They operate in the field (initially in Ghana) using the mobile and web apps to serve customers. [cite: 1] [cite_start]Their main goals are to efficiently sign up new customers, process deposits and withdrawals quickly and without errors, and track their commissions. [cite: 1, 8]

### The Clerk / Teller
[cite_start]This user is responsible for the physical cash management with the Field Agents. [cite: 11] [cite_start]They will use a dedicated interface (likely on the web app) to record cash received from agents (daily collections) and cash issued to agents (daily float). [cite: 11] [cite_start]A key part of their role is using the system to perform reconciliation, ensuring an agent's reported electronic transactions match the physical cash being exchanged. [cite: 11]

### Company Admin
[cite_start]The owner or manager of an "Agent Company" that uses the Sabs platform. [cite: 8] This user needs to oversee their own group of Field Agents and Clerks. [cite_start]Their goals are to monitor their company's overall performance, manage their agents, view financial reports, and handle administrative tasks specific to their own business. [cite: 9] [cite_start]They will be the primary customer for the billable SMS and AI credit services. [cite: 7]

### Super Admin
This is the ultimate platform owner. [cite_start]This role has the highest level of privilege, with a complete overview of all companies and agents operating on the system. [cite: 7] [cite_start]The Super Admin is responsible for configuring system-wide settings, such as switching the underlying AI model provider, and overseeing the health and security of the entire Sabs (v2) ecosystem. [cite: 7]

### End-Customer
The foundation of the entire ecosystem. [cite_start]Their direct interaction with the system is through accessible channels (USSD, a simple web portal, and a simple Android app). [cite: 5] [cite_start]Their primary goals are to have a simple, reliable way to check their balance, and to initiate deposits and withdrawals. [cite: 4, 5]
