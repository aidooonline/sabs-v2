# sabs v2: Global Project Principles

This document outlines the high-level strategic rules that apply to the entire project.

1.  **Full Channel Parity:** All features, for all user roles (including Admins, Clerks, and Agents), must be available and fully functional on both the web portal and the mobile application. We will not build web-only or mobile-only features.

2.  **Security First:** The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system is a top-priority, non-negotiable component of the architecture.

3.  **Company Self-Service:** Company Admins must have a feature to view available service packages and subscribe to or purchase them directly.

4.  **Platform Master Key:** A hidden, hardcoded, ultimate access control mechanism must be built into the system's foundation to allow for emergency control over all accounts, including Super Admins.
