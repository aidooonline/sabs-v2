## 🔧 KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. **Complete MSW + RTK Query Integration**
- ✅ Fixed MSW v1 compatibility issues
- ✅ Added essential Node.js polyfills (TextEncoder, TextDecoder, BroadcastChannel)
- ✅ Enhanced Request/Response polyfills with `arrayBuffer()` support
- ✅ Proper MSW v1 syntax implementation (`rest` instead of `http`)

### 2. **Data Structure Standardization**
- ✅ Fixed mock data to match `approvalHelpers.ts` expectations
- ✅ Implemented proper nested structure (`workflow.withdrawalRequest.amount`)
- ✅ Consistent data models across all test files
- ✅ Full compatibility with production data schema

### 3. **Jest Setup Enhancement**
- ✅ Comprehensive browser API mocks (ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver)
- ✅ Enhanced fetch mock with proper clone support for RTK Query
- ✅ WebSocket mock implementation for real-time features
- ✅ MSW-compatible beforeEach handlers

### 4. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
- ✅ Created modular test structure (minimal, simple, comprehensive)
- ✅ Proper Redux store configuration for tests
- ✅ Real RTK Query middleware integration
- ✅ Comprehensive mock data generation (125 workflows)

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### **Critical Problem Solving**
1. **MSW Polyfill Issues:** Resolved `TextEncoder is not defined` and `BroadcastChannel is not defined`
2. **Data Structure Mismatch:** Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'amount')`
3. **RTK Query Integration:** Enabled proper MSW + RTK Query cooperation
4. **Test Environment:** Created production-like test conditions

### **Files Created/Modified**
- `frontend/jest.setup.js` - Enhanced with MSW polyfills
- `frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.test.tsx` - Complete rewrite with MSW v1
- `frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.minimal.test.tsx` - New validation test
- `frontend/tests/components/ApprovalDashboard.simple.test.tsx` - Updated structure
- Multiple mock data standardizations
